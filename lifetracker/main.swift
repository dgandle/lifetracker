// Use them like regular Swift objects
let myDog = Dog()
myDog.name = "Rex"

// Get the default Realm

// Query Realm for all dogs less than 2 years old
let puppies = realm.objects(Dog.self).filter("age < 2")
puppies.count // => 0 because no dogs have been added to the Realm yet

// Persist your data easily
try! realm.write {

// Queries are updated in realtime
puppies.count // => 1
